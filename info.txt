Volatility Analysis:

- Volatility analysis refers to the examination of the degree of variation of a trading price series over time. 
- In financial markets, volatility is a key indicator of the level of risk or uncertainty associated with an asset. 
- Traders and investors often use volatility analysis to make informed decisions about trading strategies, risk management, and portfolio allocation
Volatility Index (VIX): often referred to as the "fear gauge." popular measure of market volatility. It represents the market's expectations for future volatility 

Correlation Analysis:

- Correlation analysis is a statistical method used to evaluate the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two or more variables. 
- In financial markets, correlation analysis is commonly applied to study the relationship between the returns of different assets.
- Helping investors and analysts understand how assets move relative to each other.

r = correlation coefficient
    r=1 indicates a perfect positive correlation.  - An increase in one variable tends to be associated with an increase in the other
    r=âˆ’1 indicates a perfect negative correlation.  - An increase in one variable is associated with a decrease in the other
    r=0 indicates no linear correlation.            - If there is little to no linear relationship between the variable

Correlation matrix: In financial markets, analysts often use a correlation matrix to display the correlation coefficients between multiple assets. 
A correlation matrix provides a comprehensive view of how assets move relative to each other.

  of individual stocks, portfolios, or indices. 
- This analysis is crucial for investors and traders to assess the trade-off between potential returns and the level of risk associated with their investments.
- Daily Returns = (Closing Price (i) - Closing Price (i-1) / Closing Price (i-1) ) / 100
- Daily volatility measures the degree of variation in daily returns and is often represented as the standard deviation of daily returns.
- Sharpe ratio is which measures the excess return per unit of risk 
  Sharpe Ratio = Average Daily Return / Standard Deviation of Daily Returns.
